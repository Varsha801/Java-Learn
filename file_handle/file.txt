Files in Java might be tricky, but it is fun enough!
If you want to use this code, you should make sure that you have a file named "filename.txt" in the same directory as the Java source code file or provide the correct path to the file you want to read. 
Additionally, handle the file exceptions or errors gracefully based on your application's requirements.
